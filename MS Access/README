This folder contains some parts of my work in Access, made for our family business like
- a picture about the connections of the database
- SQL codes of a few Queries
- a report printed to PDF (first page only, prices and names removed).

The tanning beds in our tanning salons are operated via a specific software. This software
saves the data of all the memberships and sales. I recreated the database for analysis and
supervising, incuding but not limited to
- monthly sales reports on individual sales - compared to the number of customers in the
  salesperson's shifts
- general income reports for forecasting
- analysing and planning our sales by membership statistics
- supervising the amount of free usage (for our employees and in case of failure/test)

Every event (selling, paid tanning, prepaid tanning/membership, selling memberships) is
recorded, the size of the card_events table is over 100.000 rows.

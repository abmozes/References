This is an unfinished project of a form application, which automatizes the calculations for
the board game called Chicago Express (see my previous work of the same purpose, an Excel
sheet with buttons and VBA windows). The work left unfinished few years ago since the board
game was not so popular between friends and family, but is and was a good practice of
different tools that I learned to use by myself.
